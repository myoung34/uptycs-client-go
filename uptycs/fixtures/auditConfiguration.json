Contact details should\nnot be for a single individual, as circumstances may arise where that individual is\nunavailable. Email contact details should point to a mail alias which forwards email to\nmultiple individuals within the organization; where feasible, phone contact details should\npoint to a PABX hunt group or other call-forwarding system.",
      "rationale": "If an AWS account is observed to be behaving in a prohibited or suspicious manner, AWS\nwill attempt to contact the account owner by email and phone using the contact details\nlisted. If this is unsuccessful and the account behavior needs urgent mitigation, proactive\nmeasures may be taken, including throttling of traffic between the account exhibiting\nsuspicious behavior and the AWS API endpoints and the Internet. This will result in\nimpaired service to and from the account in question, so it is in both the customers' and\nAWS' best interests that prompt contact can be established. This is best achieved by setting\nAWS account contact details to point to resources which have multiple individuals as\nrecipients, such as email aliases and PABX hunt groups.",
